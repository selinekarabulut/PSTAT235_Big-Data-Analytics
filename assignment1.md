## MovieLens Dataset

In this assignment, we will be working on a new dataset. To download it paste the following URL into your laptop's browser: `http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest.zip`. Alternatively, you can also go to `https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/` and download `ml-latest.zip`.

This dataset has around 27 million ratings on about 58,000 movies done by over 280,000 users and last updated on 9/2018. Unzip this 288 MB file. For the purpose of this assignment we will be using only two of the files that are included: 

1. `movies.csv` (2.9 MB) 
2. `ratings.csv` (760 MB).

## Question 1: Uploading Data to BigQuery

Upload these two files into a dataset in BigQuery and call it `movie_ratings`. 

Create a new dataset and call it `movie_ratings`. We will load these two files into the newly created dataset two ways: using the web interface and agian using cloud shell.

### Question 1a: `movies` table 

To create `movies` table from `movies.csv` file,

1. Download the zipped file
2. Unzip the archive
3. In your BigQuery interface, select in the resources list `<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>` > `movie_ratings` > click **"CREATE TABLE"** button
4. `Create table from`: `Upload`  
    `Select file`: BROWSE and find `movies.csv` from your computer  
    `Table`: `movies`  
    Schema `Auto detect`: check  

Find your LOAD job information from `PROJECT HISTORY` (next to `PERSONAL HISTORY`) at the bottom. Mine looks like @fig-job-info

Post screenshot of your LOAD job information here:

### Question 1b: `ratings` table

Follow the same procedure as Question 1a to crate `ratings` table from `ratings.csv`. What happens?

<strong> Answer </strong>

It didn't let us to upload `ratings.csv` (below is the screenshot of the warning generated by the system) because local uploads are limited to 100 MB and this file (760 MB) is larger than that.

**PSTAT 135 Students**: Upload `ratings.csv` file to Cloud Storage and create `ratings` table from it using the web interface. Then, post the screenshot of your LOAD job information here:

**Replace this text with your screenshot image**

**PSTAT 235 Students**: Upload `ratings.csv` file to Cloud Storage and create `ratings` table using the commmand line tools: `bq` and `gsutil`.

1. Verify the location of `ratings.csv` file using Cloud Storage command:  

    ```bash
    gsutil ls gs://<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>
    ```
    Note your the path to your `ratings.csv` file (referred to as `<RATINGS-FILE-LOCATION>` below).
2. Create an empty table with `bq`. Read the documentation, `bq mk --help` to fill-in the blanks in the code below:

    ```bash
    bq mk _______
    ```
3. Using `bq` command to load `movie_ratings.ratings` table with contents from  `<RATINGS-FILE-LOCATION>`. Read the documentation, `bq load --help` to fill-in the blanks in the code below:

    ```bash
    bq load --autodetect _______  _______
    ```

Replace the section below with your own commands:
```bash
gsutil ls gs://<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>
bq mk _______
bq load --autodetect _______  _______
```

<strong> Answer </strong>

```bash
gsutil ls gs://pstat235-sk
bq mk --table movie_ratings.ratings
bq load --autodetect movie_ratings.ratings  gs://pstat235-sk/ratings.csv
```
